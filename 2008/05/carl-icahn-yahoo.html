		<p>雖然最近忙到翻掉，但是看到這麼戲劇性的東西，還是要寫一下當紀念的 :p</p>

<p>就在 Steve Ballmer 說微軟決定撤回對 Yahoo 的併購案之後，今晚 Carl Icahn 對 Yahoo 董事會<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080515/yahoo_icahn.html">開砲</a>了，發表了一封公開信。這位老兄好怒啊。他形容雅虎董事會</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>「躲在管理階層過度樂觀的財務預測後面，十分不負責任。」</p>
</blockquote>

<p>他也說，</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>「微軟的提案十分慷慨，對雅虎的估價比公開求婚的前一天還要高出 72%。拒絕這個提議顯然是非常不理智的。」</p>
</blockquote>

<p>實力雄厚的 Carl Icahn，除了開罵以外，也擺明他不是只有一張嘴而已。公開信中聲稱，他已經花了十三億美金買了雅虎五千九百萬股 (大約佔雅虎 4% 股權)。而且他正在向美國聯邦交易委員會提出申請，希望得到反托拉斯的許可，以便買下價值二十五億美金的雅虎股權 (大約 8% 左右)。</p>

<p>Icahn 表示不只贊成微軟的購併案，而且也打算提案撤換雅虎的董事會 – 他已經公開提了一個十人名單，希望能夠在七月三號的雅虎股東年會上面，取得多數董事席位。十人都是赫赫有名，除了他自己以外，還包括：</p>

<ul>
  <li>網路創業傳奇人物 Mark Cuban</li>
  <li>Viacom 創辦人 Frank Biondi Jr.</li>
  <li>New Line Cenima 的 CEO Robert Shaye</li>
  <li>創投家 Adam Dell。啥？你不認識他？那你至少該認得他哥哥 Michael Dell 吧？</li>
</ul>

<p>Carl Icahn 這些舉動的背後，和微軟的 Steve Ballmer 有沒有什麼默契或是私下的合作，是很耐人尋味的。不過這是楊致遠和雅虎董事會要擔心的事情了。我們只要負責看連續劇看不到的好戲就好了啊！ XD</p>

<p>話說回來，楊致遠接任 CEO 以後，風波總是不斷。他能夠有時間精力來做好公司重整的工作嗎？我很懷疑。光是應付微軟大巨獸想必就已經筋疲力竭了。現在又來一個 Carl Icahn，恐怕難得有一夜好眠了…</p>

<p>[註] Carl Icahn 是具有傳奇色彩的投資人。他以爭取股東權益聞名，令許多上市公司老闆聞之色變。最近的事蹟是投資摩托羅拉事件。他所投資的公司，通常伴隨著大規模的重整，包括經營階層的重新洗牌與裁員。<br />
[註二] 公開信的全文在<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/080515/nyth088.html">這裡</a>可以看到。我照引如下：</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SECURITY HOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE SOLICITATION OF PROXIES BY Carl C. Icahn AND HIS AFFILIATES FROM THE STOCKHOLDERS OF YAHOO! INC. FOR USE AT ITS ANNUAL MEETING, WHEN AND IF THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING INFORMATION RELATING TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN ANY SUCH PROXY SOLICITATION. WHEN AND IF COMPLETED, A DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT AND A FORM OF PROXY WILL BE MAILED TO STOCKHOLDERS OF YAHOO! INC. AND WILL ALSO BE AVAILABLE AT NO CHARGE AT THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION’S WEBSITE AT <a href="http://www.sec.gov/">HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV</a>. INFORMATION RELATING TO THE POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS IN A POTENTIAL PROXY SOLICITATION IS CONTAINED IN EXHIBIT 1 TO THE SCHEDULE 14A BEING FILED TODAY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.</p>

  <pre>Carl C. Icahn<br />                           ICAHN CAPITAL LP<br />                     767 Fifth Avenue, 47th Floor<br />                          New York, NY 10153<br /><br />May 15, 2008<br /><br />Roy Bostock<br />Chairman<br />Yahoo! Inc.<br />701 First Avenue<br />Sunnyvale, CA 94089<br /><br />Dear Mr. Bostock:<br /></pre>

  <p>It is clear to me that the board of directors of Yahoo has acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders and Microsoft. It is quite obvious that Microsoft’s bid of $33 per share is a superior alternative to Yahoo’s prospects on a standalone basis. I am perplexed by the board’s actions. It is irresponsible to hide behind management’s more than overly optimistic financial forecasts. It is unconscionable that you have not allowed your shareholders to choose to accept an offer that represented a 72% premium over Yahoo’s closing price of $19.18 on the day before the initial Microsoft offer. I and many of your shareholders strongly believe that a combination between Yahoo and Microsoft would form a dynamic company and more importantly would be a force strong enough to compete with Google on the Internet.</p>

  <p>During the past week, a number of shareholders have asked me to lead a proxy fight to attempt to remove the current board and to establish a new board which would attempt to negotiate a successful merger with Microsoft, something that in my opinion the current board has completely botched. I believe that a combination between Microsoft and Yahoo is by far the most sensible path for both companies. I have therefore taken the following actions: (1) during the last 10 days, I have purchased approximately 59 million shares and share-equivalents of Yahoo; (2) I have formed a 10-person slate which will stand for election against the current board; and (3) I have sought antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to acquire up to approximately $2.5 billion worth of Yahoo stock. The biographies of the members of our slate are attached to this letter. A more formal notification is being delivered today to Yahoo under separate cover.</p>

  <p>While it is my understanding that you do not intend to enter into any transaction that would impede a Microsoft-Yahoo merger, I am concerned that in several recent press releases you stated that you intend to pursue certain “strategic alternatives”. I therefore hope and trust that if there is any question that these “strategic alternatives” might in any way impede a future Microsoft merger you will at the very least allow shareholders to opine on them before embarking on such a transaction.</p>

  <p>I sincerely hope you heed the wishes of your shareholders and move expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary.</p>

  <pre>Sincerely yours,<br /><br />CARL C. ICAHN<br /><br />                          SLATE BIOGRAPHIES<br /></pre>
