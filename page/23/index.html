				Yahoo 終於開放通訊錄的 API 了

		<p>等的好久啊…</p>

<p>以前 <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/mail/">Yahoo Mail</a> 剛推出 API 的時候，很多人都在紛紛詢問，到底要怎麼撈通訊錄的名單呢？當時的官方說法是，<a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2007/03/mail.html#comments">根本不提供這個 API</a>。但是像是 flickr 的 friends finder 就很明顯有內部的 api 可以使用，也因此被不少人詬病說開放只開一半。</p>

<p>但是這方面的需求始終不少，所以很多人都用一些旁門左道的方式來撈 – 比方說把使用者的寄信匣中的收件人撈一次，可以得到類似通訊錄的效果。</p>

<p>現在開始終於不用走這些旁門左道啦。今天看到，<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/addressbook/">Yahoo Addressbook</a> 終於也開放了 API 可以讀取。以後如果要讓 user 互相匯入匯出使用者資料就方便多囉。</p>

<p>雖然是這樣，但是公告上面每天 5000 個 queries 還是實在有點小氣。大一點的網站，像是 LinkedIn 提供的功能，每個小時就不只 5000 個 queries 了吧？不過雖然小氣了點，至少隔了一年多 API 總是開出來了，也算是踏出了好的開始啊。</p>

<p>原始 blog post <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2008/06/addressbook_api.html">在這邊</a>。</p>

		<p>今天看到<a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/05/more-ec2-power.html">消息</a>，<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon EC2</a> 已經開始提供兩個新的 instance type，給 CPU 需求量較大的人使用。新的 instance type 分別是：</p>

<ul>
  <li>$0.2/hour，1.7G ram，5 個 EC2 computing units，32bit platform</li>
  <li>$0.8/hour，7G ram，20 個 EC2 computing units，64bit platform</li>
</ul>

<p>如果 application 是 CPU-bound 的話，也許新種的 instance type 會比較合用。不過我倒是比較希望看到，只要 $0.05/hour 的 mini-instance，這樣對 prototyping 比較合適 :p</p>

<p>Anyway，<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">EC2</a> 網站上也已經公告新的 instance type 了。</p>

				Yahoo 正式回應 Icahn 的公開信

		<p>好戲果然就應該連播不停…</p>

<p>昨晚 <a href="http://mclee.foolme.net/2008/05/carl-icahn-yahoo.html">Icahn 發表公開信</a>，表明要發動 proxy battle 撤換 Yahoo 董事會以後，不到 12 小時，Yahoo 董事長 Roy Bostock 也發了正式的回應。</p>

<p>因為 Icahn 擺明他的目標就是要讓 Yahoo 重回談判桌跟微軟協商，Roy Bostock 在信中也指出，</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>「請容我提醒你，『現在』並沒有微軟、或是其他公司提出的購併提案。」</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>「你準備強迫 Yahoo 賣給一個前求婚者，而這家公司已經公開宣稱他們『繼續前行』。我們並不相信這符合 Yahoo 股東的利益。」</p>
</blockquote>

<p>信中除了辯解和微軟協商的過程，表示雅虎並沒有一開始就拒人於千里之外以外，也不忘記強調，</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>「Yahoo 目前的十人董事會，包括 CEO 楊致遠，仍然是最能夠讓 Yahoo 股東權益最佳化的團隊。」</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bostock 為董事會的決策辯護是可以理解的。至於賣給微軟是對還是錯？這種問題當然沒有答案。Icahn 當然可以藉著逼使雅虎賣給微軟大賺一票，但是對楊致遠和 David Filo 來說則是情何以堪。但是，感情和面子是不能夠在資本市場上說服投資人的。雅虎過去四年的股價曲線實在不好，現在的董事會要怎麼讓投資人相信，雅虎可以憑藉一己之力力挽狂瀾，這才是當務之急的重點。</p>

<p>好戲連篇。我們就等著看這段，彷如 <a href="http://mclee.foolme.net/2008/05/carl-icahn-yahoo.html#comment-5772136246012035167">Oracle 和 BEA Systems</a> 重演的戲碼吧。</p>

<p>[註] Bostock 公開回應的<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/paidcontent/080515/1_323493_id.html">全文</a>可以在這邊看到。我照引如下。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>May 15, 2008<br />
Dear Mr. Icahn:</p>

  <p>We are in receipt of your letter with regard to your intention to seek control of Yahoo!’s board of directors.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, your letter reflects a significant misunderstanding of the facts about the Microsoft proposal and the diligence with which our board evaluated and responded to that proposal. A fair-minded review of the factual record leads to one conclusion: that Yahoo!’s ten-member board, comprised of nine independent directors along with Yahoo! CEO Jerry Yang, remains the best and most qualified group to maximize value for all Yahoo! stockholders.</p>

  <p>Conversely, we do not believe it is in the best interests of Yahoo! stockholders to allow you and your hand-picked nominees to take control of Yahoo! for the express purpose of trying to force a sale of Yahoo! to a formerly interested buyer who has publicly stated that they have moved on. Please may I remind you that there is currently no acquisition offer on the table from that company or any other party. That said, we have been crystal clear in our stance that we have been and remain willing to consider any proposal from any party including Microsoft if it offers our stockholders full and certain value.</p>

  <p>From the beginning of the process with Microsoft, Yahoo!’s independent directors focused on one central goal: how best to maximize stockholder value. At all times directing this process, Yahoo!’s independent directors carefully considered Microsoft’s initial unsolicited proposal, which was at the time valued at $31 per share. After considering input from its financial advisers the board unanimously concluded that Microsoft’s proposal significantly undervalued Yahoo! and was, therefore, not in the best interests of the company or our stockholders. While we rejected this offer publicly on February 11, 2008, we could not have been more clear in that communication and in every subsequent communication, both public and private, that we were and are willing to enter into any transaction that would maximize value for stockholders and provide them certainty of value.</p>

  <p>The record of our efforts to engage Microsoft in meaningful discussions is unequivocal. Following receipt of Microsoft’s proposal on January 31, our board of directors has met over twenty times to review Microsoft’s proposal and Yahoo!’s other strategic alternatives. Throughout this process our board kept an open mind and an open ear. Our independent directors met with several of our largest stockholders to solicit their views and to make it clear that Yahoo!’s independent board is fully committed to maximizing stockholder value. In addition, at the direction of our board, our management team met with many of our investors to provide insight into Yahoo!’s strategy and views on value.</p>

  <p>Our board’s openness also extended to Microsoft. Without reciting all of the contacts between us and between our advisers, the senior-most management of Yahoo! and Microsoft and the companies’ respective financial advisers spoke on numerous occasions and met in person seven times. During those meetings, Yahoo! discussed its strategic objectives in search and display advertising monetization, its perspectives on operating strategy and integration in a transaction with Microsoft, its perspectives on transaction synergies, and other non-price deal terms. Because certainty of closing is a critical issue, we sought to understand Microsoft’s thinking with regard to the regulatory issues associated with a potential transaction. In fact, at the board’s direction, our lawyers on March 28 asked for additional information in this regard, information which was never forthcoming.</p>

  <p>On April 15th, a meeting was held at Yahoo!’s request. At that meeting, which included our respective financial advisors, we made clear, once again, that we were open to a transaction with Microsoft. During those discussions, Yahoo! made a detailed presentation of its strategic and financial plan, its thoughts on integration and its view with respect to the potential synergies that could be achieved in a transaction, essentially laying the foundation for Microsoft to understand–and respond to–our board’s conclusion that Microsoft’s offer substantially undervalued the company. Following that meeting we also provided to Microsoft a list of key non-price deal terms that our board believed were critical items to be addressed in a deal to provide reasonable protections for our stockholders.</p>

  <p>Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to state that it would not raise its offer, and even suggested that it could lower it.</p>

  <p>Despite this failure by Microsoft to respond in any substantive way to any of Yahoo!’s requests, on May 2nd, the same day we first learned of Microsoft’s apparent willingness to increase its proposal to $33 (although this oral “offer” was never delivered in writing and did not include details of a cash/stock mix), our board determined to continue discussions, instructing Jerry Yang to indicate to Microsoft that we would be prepared to enter into a transaction that valued Yahoo! at $37 per share and that provided reasonable certainty of value and certainty of closing. This was communicated to Microsoft in-person at a meeting in Seattle on May 3rd. With Microsoft’s offer at $33 and Yahoo!’s counter-proposal at $37, Microsoft elected, within hours, to walk away from the negotiating table and informed us that they were “moving on,” having never engaged further on price or any of the key non-price deal terms.</p>

  <p>In short, Yahoo!’s board was at every point in this process prepared to enter into a transaction with Microsoft that would maximize stockholder value–and included certainty of value and closing. What Yahoo!’s independent board refused to do was to allow control of this company to be acquired for less than its full value.</p>

  <p>That brings us to today. Our business is performing well as evidenced by our first quarter results. As we have publicly stated, our board continues to actively and expeditiously explore strategic alternatives to maximize stockholder value. None of the alternatives we are considering would preclude us from entering into a transaction with Microsoft or any other party.</p>

  <p>We continue to believe that Yahoo!’s current board has the independence, the knowledge, and the commitment to navigate the Company through the rapidly changing Internet environment and to deliver value for Yahoo! and its stockholders.</p>

  <p>We look forward to a productive dialogue.</p>

  <p>Very truly yours,</p>

  <p>Roy Bostock</p>

  <p>Chairman of the Board</p>

				鉅子 Carl Icahn 對 Yahoo 董事會開砲了

		<p>雖然最近忙到翻掉，但是看到這麼戲劇性的東西，還是要寫一下當紀念的 :p</p>

<p>就在 Steve Ballmer 說微軟決定撤回對 Yahoo 的併購案之後，今晚 Carl Icahn 對 Yahoo 董事會<a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080515/yahoo_icahn.html">開砲</a>了，發表了一封公開信。這位老兄好怒啊。他形容雅虎董事會</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>「躲在管理階層過度樂觀的財務預測後面，十分不負責任。」</p>
</blockquote>

<p>他也說，</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>「微軟的提案十分慷慨，對雅虎的估價比公開求婚的前一天還要高出 72%。拒絕這個提議顯然是非常不理智的。」</p>
</blockquote>

<p>實力雄厚的 Carl Icahn，除了開罵以外，也擺明他不是只有一張嘴而已。公開信中聲稱，他已經花了十三億美金買了雅虎五千九百萬股 (大約佔雅虎 4% 股權)。而且他正在向美國聯邦交易委員會提出申請，希望得到反托拉斯的許可，以便買下價值二十五億美金的雅虎股權 (大約 8% 左右)。</p>

<p>Icahn 表示不只贊成微軟的購併案，而且也打算提案撤換雅虎的董事會 – 他已經公開提了一個十人名單，希望能夠在七月三號的雅虎股東年會上面，取得多數董事席位。十人都是赫赫有名，除了他自己以外，還包括：</p>

<ul>
  <li>網路創業傳奇人物 Mark Cuban</li>
  <li>Viacom 創辦人 Frank Biondi Jr.</li>
  <li>New Line Cenima 的 CEO Robert Shaye</li>
  <li>創投家 Adam Dell。啥？你不認識他？那你至少該認得他哥哥 Michael Dell 吧？</li>
</ul>

<p>Carl Icahn 這些舉動的背後，和微軟的 Steve Ballmer 有沒有什麼默契或是私下的合作，是很耐人尋味的。不過這是楊致遠和雅虎董事會要擔心的事情了。我們只要負責看連續劇看不到的好戲就好了啊！ XD</p>

<p>話說回來，楊致遠接任 CEO 以後，風波總是不斷。他能夠有時間精力來做好公司重整的工作嗎？我很懷疑。光是應付微軟大巨獸想必就已經筋疲力竭了。現在又來一個 Carl Icahn，恐怕難得有一夜好眠了…</p>

<p>[註] Carl Icahn 是具有傳奇色彩的投資人。他以爭取股東權益聞名，令許多上市公司老闆聞之色變。最近的事蹟是投資摩托羅拉事件。他所投資的公司，通常伴隨著大規模的重整，包括經營階層的重新洗牌與裁員。<br />

  <pre>Carl C. Icahn<br />                           ICAHN CAPITAL LP<br />                     767 Fifth Avenue, 47th Floor<br />                          New York, NY 10153<br /><br />May 15, 2008<br /><br />Roy Bostock<br />Chairman<br />Yahoo! Inc.<br />701 First Avenue<br />Sunnyvale, CA 94089<br /><br />Dear Mr. Bostock:<br /></pre>

  <p>It is clear to me that the board of directors of Yahoo has acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders and Microsoft. It is quite obvious that Microsoft’s bid of $33 per share is a superior alternative to Yahoo’s prospects on a standalone basis. I am perplexed by the board’s actions. It is irresponsible to hide behind management’s more than overly optimistic financial forecasts. It is unconscionable that you have not allowed your shareholders to choose to accept an offer that represented a 72% premium over Yahoo’s closing price of $19.18 on the day before the initial Microsoft offer. I and many of your shareholders strongly believe that a combination between Yahoo and Microsoft would form a dynamic company and more importantly would be a force strong enough to compete with Google on the Internet.</p>

  <p>During the past week, a number of shareholders have asked me to lead a proxy fight to attempt to remove the current board and to establish a new board which would attempt to negotiate a successful merger with Microsoft, something that in my opinion the current board has completely botched. I believe that a combination between Microsoft and Yahoo is by far the most sensible path for both companies. I have therefore taken the following actions: (1) during the last 10 days, I have purchased approximately 59 million shares and share-equivalents of Yahoo; (2) I have formed a 10-person slate which will stand for election against the current board; and (3) I have sought antitrust clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to acquire up to approximately $2.5 billion worth of Yahoo stock. The biographies of the members of our slate are attached to this letter. A more formal notification is being delivered today to Yahoo under separate cover.</p>

  <p>While it is my understanding that you do not intend to enter into any transaction that would impede a Microsoft-Yahoo merger, I am concerned that in several recent press releases you stated that you intend to pursue certain “strategic alternatives”. I therefore hope and trust that if there is any question that these “strategic alternatives” might in any way impede a future Microsoft merger you will at the very least allow shareholders to opine on them before embarking on such a transaction.</p>

  <p>I sincerely hope you heed the wishes of your shareholders and move expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary.</p>

  <pre>Sincerely yours,<br /><br />CARL C. ICAHN<br /><br />                          SLATE BIOGRAPHIES<br /></pre>

				非官方的 Amazon EC2 persistent storage

		<div class="fb-social-plugin fb-like" data-font="arial" data-ref="above-post" data-href="https://mclee.foolme.net/2008/05/amazon-ec2-persistent-storage.html" data-show-faces="true" data-width="300"></div>

		<p>我還滿好奇的，<a href="http://www.netapp.com/">NetApp</a> 怎麼還沒倒啊？</p>

<p>大家都知道，Amazon 提供的 webservices 搭配起來可以多強多猛。EC2 + S3 + SQS + SimpleDB 簡直就是無敵。但是問題在 EC2 的 instance 上面，沒有可靠的儲存裝置可以使用。S3 雖然很保險，可是操作 S3 沒有辦法像操作 filesystem 那樣方便，而 S3 的 latency 也不允許一層 <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">FUSE</a> 的介面操作。</p>

<p>上個月 Amazon <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=21082&amp;tstart=0">公佈說</a>，將來會開始支援 persistence storage 了。你可以動態要求任意大小的單位容量 – 小從 1 GB 大到 1TB – 而且還不限制單位數目。也就是說你可以輕輕鬆鬆要好幾個 1TB 的儲存單位，放置你想放的東西。還支援 snapshot 備分到 S3 上面，達到更強固的備分效果。Amazon 的 Jeff Barr 也在他們官方的 blog 上面<a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2008/04/block-to-the-fu.html">貼了一篇</a>簡單教學，告訴你應該怎麼操作。</p>

<p>聽起來很棒對不對？真的是很棒。可惜現在 API 還沒有正式上線。這段時間如果覺得需要 persistent storage 的人，就只能自己硬幹了。… 可是我沒想到這年頭還真的有人這麼熱血！XD</p>

<p>今天在<a href="http://docs.google.com/View?docID=dhh4z6n4_96w387mqhn&amp;revision=_latest">這邊</a>看到一篇文章，是一篇完整的 howto，用 DRBD、LVM、Heartbeat 等元素組出來一套建構在 EC2 上面的「persistent storage」。雖然說是 persistent 但是畢竟不如 Amazon 官方製作的一般，可以完全獨立於 EC2 instance 以外。但是大部分功能都已經很齊備了，諸如 failover、redundancy、snapshot 等功能一應俱全。雖然建構起來頗費工夫，但是對於已經需要上線運作 (換句話說沒空等 Amazon 官方 release 的 solution)、又很擔心資料完整性的人，倒是很適合的。</p>

<p>話說回來，等到 Amazon EC2 官方版的 persistent storage 上線以後，還有多少人要買 <a href="http://www.netapp.com/us/">NetApp</a>？XD 這年頭買 NetApp，根本已經完全不符合成本效益了。</p>
